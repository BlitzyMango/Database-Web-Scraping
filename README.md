# Database-Web-Scraping
## Overview
This is a repository I created to perform web scraping for a school project. The program extracts multiple subdirectories from a video game website and is able to send them to a previously initialized Oracle SQL table. In order to submit data to Oracle, proper information (e.g. username, password, hostname, etc.) must be declared inside the config.py file.

## Motivation
I created this project to showcase my webscraping skills, but did not create an easy method of setting up and testing the program (i.e. using a UI) due to time constraints. I plan on implementing a user-friendly way of scraping data from a particular webpage and add it to a non-proprietary/open-source database like PostgreSQL in the future.
