# Database-Web-Scraping

## Overview
This is a repository I created to perform web scraping for a school project. The program extracts multiple subdirectories from a video game website and is able to send them to a previously initialized Oracle SQL table. In order to submit data to Oracle, proper information (e.g. username, password, hostname, etc.) must be declared inside the config.py file.
